Hi!

searching for someone who could build me woocommerce shop for mainly laptops with different attributes on product pages (clients can change RAM, SSD, with or without opsystem etc and each change will show a different product price).
data will be imported from json file from specific url we provide. Source shop and our partner is this
www.x-kom.pl. From there at the beginning we only take laptops category (3 of them) , here -> https://www.x-kom.pl/g/2-laptopy-i-komputery.html maybe later some other categories aswell so the setup must be universal. here is an example of laptop with different attributes you can change on their website: https://www.x-kom.pl/p/1355931-laptop-15-16-asus-tuf-gaming-a16-ryzen-7-7445hs-32gb-512-rtx4050-144hz.html Filters on the left also have to be implemented according to attributes (manufacturer, ram, etc) shop will be put here > www.arvutipoisid.ee (we will provide access of course) Design layout something similar like this https://www.oixio.ee/et/e-pood/s%C3%BClearvutid (of course not exact copy) let me know if you are interested! br, Mait

Hi Mait,

Thanks for the detailed explanation. I’ve carefully checked all the links and examples you shared, including x-kom.pl and the specific laptop variation page.

Yes, I can confidently develop this WooCommerce shop exactly as you described.

Regarding **laptop product variations**:
I fully understand how laptop configurations work (RAM, SSD, OS, GPU, screen, etc.). You can have **as many variations as needed**, and each combination will correctly update the product price on the product page. WooCommerce variable products will be structured cleanly and efficiently, even for complex laptop setups.

**Data import from JSON**:
I can set up automated import from your provided JSON URL, mapping all attributes (manufacturer, RAM, storage, CPU, OS, price, stock, etc.) properly into WooCommerce products and variations. The system will be built in a **universal way**, so adding more categories later will be smooth.

**Filters & attributes**:
All left-side filters (manufacturer, RAM, SSD, CPU, screen size, etc.) will be implemented based on real product attributes, ensuring fast and accurate filtering.

**Design**:
I can create a clean, modern layout inspired by oixio.ee (not a copy), optimized for laptop browsing and comparison.

I’m definitely interested in this project and ready to proceed once access is provided.
Let me know the next steps.

Best regards,
Tonni

Hi Mait,

I’m sharing a few laptop product examples with the type of **variations and configuration options** you’re looking for.

I will develop your website using a **premium theme** that is one of the best choices for electronics and laptop stores. Below are a couple of sample product pages to demonstrate that I clearly understand the structure, variation handling, and pricing logic you need. The final design will follow the style of your reference website—these links are shared only to show functionality and layout capability.

Sample product pages:

* [
https://woodmart.xtemos.com/mega-electronics/product/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2/](https://woodmart.xtemos.com/mega-electronics/product/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2/) * [https://woodmart.xtemos.com/mega-electronics/product/apple-macbook-pro-16-m1-pro-2/](https://woodmart.xtemos.com/mega-electronics/product/apple-macbook-pro-16-m1-pro-2/) You can review these links to see how multiple laptop configurations (RAM, SSD, OS, etc.) are handled smoothly. I will also **provide all required premium themes and plugins at no additional cost**, so you won’t need to purchase anything separately. Additionally, I offer **long-term maintenance support free of charge**, which is something I consistently provide to my clients. This is how I ensure quality, reliability, and long-term value for every project. Looking forward to your feedback. Best regards, Tonni

I can develop the complete ecommerce website with all standard WooCommerce functionality, including product variations, filters, pricing logic, and initial product setup.

I will:

Set up the full ecommerce store

Add your initial products

Configure all required attributes and variations

Ensure everything is easy to manage

Additionally, I will create a short video tutorial for you, showing step by step how you can add products, update variations, and make changes to the website by yourself later—so you won’t need technical help for day-to-day updates.

Timeline:
The total development time will be 3 days.

Cost:
The maximum total cost will be $120, with no hidden charges.

Let me know what you think, and we can move forward.

Task:
Set up the full ecommerce store (EE. EN and FI language) that looks similar layout as this ->
https://www.oixio.ee/et/e-pood/s%C3%BClearvutid , color codes (dark grey, green) to be used is to be take from here (www.mts.ee). Check the initial job description above. Add products to shop by creating a script that takes info from json file (https://mts.ee/storage/export/laptop_products_cleaned.json) and imports all the neccessary data from this file directly to woocommerce (without using any 3rd party workaround). Once project finished the file is put to crontab (by us) and it has to work as it should by pulling info from json and put it to woocommerce to keep the shop up to date (new products added, old products deleted, prices checked, stock availability checked and so on). We do not want to add product manually. Script should be able to do it automatically. We keep the json file up to date ourselves. Configure all required attributes and variations that come from json Ensure everything is easy to manage

I’ll provide all required premium themes and plugins at no extra cost, and after completion I’ll share a short video guide so you can easily manage the site yourself.
Because this project includes a cron-based automated JSON import system (products, prices, stock, updates, deletions) and a three-language setup (EE, EN, FI), the scope is advanced.
Total cost: $350

Could you please tell me how much data you want to import and check every day? Is it a large amount? For example, is it thousands of products with many variations? In that case, the operation may take quite a long time.

This is how the system is designed to work.

You will manage product data through JSON files, which can be stored in Google Drive or any other cloud storage. For example, initially you upload a JSON file containing 10 products. Later, you upload a new JSON file with an additional 20 products.

The script will fetch the latest JSON file, compare it with the previously processed data, identify only the new records, and then import only the new products into WordPress. This incremental import approach keeps the process efficient and optimized.

If instead the script had to validate data by scanning the entire WordPress database every time, it would need to check records from start to end. That would significantly increase execution time, server load, and operational cost, which is not a good practice for scalability.

Using a “new JSON file per update” approach is the most efficient and scalable solution.
Additionally, if required, the script can also handle validation logic such as removing or updating older data based on your rules.

Please share a sample product JSON format so I can review it and define the correct structure for WordPress product imports with validations.

I’ve already developed a plugin and added functionality so it can sync data automatically. You can set a custom schedule to run the sync whenever you want. There are also options for deleting data, and you can run product imports manually at any time. You just need to provide the JSON file URL here, and it will import the products directly.
I’ve already imported the products, and I see that most of the items in the JSON are marked as “Out of stock,” with only a few marked as “In stock.” Please let me know what you prefer: should I import products that are out of stock as well, or skip them? Your JSON file currently contains a little over 3,000 products.

when will you finish all filters and variations on product pages?
I'm working on it. For the filters to work properly, the products need complete data: categories, tags, and so on.
Regarding variations: in your JSON file, do you have product variation data included? Please send me one sample product JSON that has variations, so I can map the plugin correctly and make sure it imports products with variations.
Right now, it looks like all the products in the JSON are simple products without variations. If you send me one product JSON with variations, I’ll check and set it up.

so this laptop has 4 different variations (16GB RAM and 32GB RAM and without Windows and with Windows
You can see the same product at x-kom site here ->

and if config changes then also price has to change so every variant has a different price also
A
Me
Jan 21, 5:16 PM
So, you're sure that all variations are already in the JSON file, right? Let me map the plugin and fix it so the product will import, including variations. All I need is the data in your JSON file, and it will import along with the variations. That's it.
A

Jan 21, 5:19 PM

yes, all the info is on the json file and this json file. If new laptop will be added to json with different config variations then the store update must be universal to understand this and has to be able to add all the variations that may occur to laptops. This example had 4 variations but for example Apple products have more than 4

You’re focusing on the design, but my main concern is whether our plugin is performing perfectly or not. Design can be adjusted by anyone later; the most important thing right now is that the plugin correctly imports products and that the cron job works—that’s the big deal.
Please first check whether the products are being imported correctly with all the necessary data. Once we’re sure everything is working properly on that side, we can then focus on the design part.

I think your import script is creating this issue. Nothing to do with server resources
Edited
A
Me
Jan 27, 3:00 PM
The product import script is importing data directly and injecting it into several data fields, attributes, and product variations, which is causing the server to go down. Right now, a very large amount of data has already been imported. If it were around a thousand products, it would be fine, but with almost 3,000 products including variation data, it can consume a lot of server resources.
This is exactly what I mentioned earlier: when you work with a large amount of data in WordPress, issues like this can happen, and the first symptom is often the server going down. WordPress in this setup is running as a complete monolithic application — everything is on a single server: frontend, backend, and database.
For handling large datasets, a microservices-based architecture is usually better. In that kind of setup, everything is maintained separately (frontend, backend services, database, etc.), which keeps things more optimized and scalable.
Given the current situation with the large import already completed, what can we do now?
M

[2:00 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: Product names are weird
should be full names like Id":"1306411","Name":"Katana 17 i5-13420H\/16GB\/512 RTX4050 144Hz","Producer":"MSI"

Full name = MSI Katana 17 i5-13420H\/16GB\/512 RTX4050 144Hz
[2:16 am, 05/02/2026] Md Ariful Islam: Product names are weird
should be full names like Id":"1306411","Name":"Katana 17 i5-13420H\/16GB\/512 RTX4050 144Hz","Producer":"MSI"

Full name = MSI Katana 17 i5-13420H\/16GB\/512 RTX4050 144Hz
product title is fixed now. it's display complete title now
[2:22 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: from the example I gave you this is missing still "Producer":"MSI"
[2:22 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: MSI Katana 17 i5-13420H\/16GB\/512 RTX4050 144Hz
[2:22 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: producer is missing from the beginning
[2:23 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: from the example picture it should be Dell 14 Core 7 150U/16GB/512/Win11
[2:30 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: main filters: (1st level uncollapsed)

[2:31 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: all other filters you can create from the attributes file should be collapsed
[2:33 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: SKU: on the product page should be replaced by woocommerce product ID
[2:33 am, 05/02/2026] Md Ariful Islam: ok
[2:34 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: Description and Specification

when there is no Description the Description field should be hidden and only Specification visible
if there is description available th[2:36 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: I think there is enough for you for now to fix and adjust so lets talk tomorrow
[2:36 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: going to sleep now
[2:36 am, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: have a good night!
en both fields should be visible
[5:46 pm, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: hi you here?
[5:57 pm, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: I think you should delete the attributes completely and make new import since now they are doubled
[5:57 pm, 05/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: we translated all attributes in json
[4:32 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: you have somekind of saving problem there. When you change product quantity from 1 to 2 pieces then it shows "in stock" and when you change quantity back from 2 to 1 then it stays "in stock"
[4:55 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: most probably its related to your import/sync script of how it behaves with saving data
[4:56 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: plugin conflicting with theme files


Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method Elementor\Modules\Promotions\Module::get_ally_external_scanner_url() in /data01/virt90979/domeenid/www.mtshop.ee/arvutipoisid/wp-content/plugins/elementor/modules/promotions/widgets/ally-dashboard-widget.php:34 Stack trace: #0 /data01/virt90979/domeenid/www.mtshop.ee/arvutipoisid/wp-admin/includes/template.php(1453): Elementor\Modules\Promotions\Widgets\Ally_Dashboard_Widget::ally_widget_render('', Array) #1 /data01/virt90979/domeenid/www.mtshop.ee/arvutipoisid/wp-admin/includes/dashboard.php(277): do_meta_boxes(Object(WP_Screen), 'column3', '') #2 /data01/virt90979/domeenid/www.mtshop.ee/arvutipoisid/wp-admin/index.php(204): wp_dashboard() #3 {main} thrown in /data01
are these plugins that conflict even needed to run the shop?
[5:36 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: we will investigate your import script to determine the problem
[5:36 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: what is your current action plan?
[5:39 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: when you import items with "stock quantity = 1" then woocommerce shows that this item "is not in stock". When you change product quantity from 1 to 2 pieces manually then it shows "in stock" like it should and when you change quantity back from 2 to 1 then it stays "in stock"
[5:40 pm, 06/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: this forces WooCommerce to rewrite meta; that can override the stale out of stock flag.
we need to speed up the progress from now on. can you increase your productivity?
may I ask you a question? do you know anything about computers with what you are creating your developments? Especially what is a RAM (memory) or what is a processor (CPU) or what is for example Operating system (windows) or what is Hard Drive and so on?
[2:46 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: lets start with the first filter object - price, is it a slider or not?
[2:46 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: second, manufacturer - where is Apple and Microsoft?
[2:47 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: 4th - CPU (yes or no) , what is this....????
[2:47 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: 5th, Hard drive - 120hz??????
[2:47 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: 6th. operating system - 16gb ??????
[2:47 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: 7th, GPU - 16 GB ?????
[2:48 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: basically every filter is wrong
[2:50 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: does the filter product count correspond to products and variations in you fillters? If I cound all available pcs in Manufacturer filter then I get 564 - this is the number of products and variations imported to woocommerce?
[2:52 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: Please goto your website admin and the. Go-to attribute list then let me know what we're missing
why do I need to go to attributes? you do not see the attributes yourself???
[2:54 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: ou do not see "Producer": "Apple", in the json?
[2:54 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: or "Producer": "Microsoft"
[2:54 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: ??
[2:55 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: I am not mad but confused that do you even check your work before you let me verify what have you done?
[2:56 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: current filter setup is completely wrong, there is nothing to check
[2:56 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: lets start with the product count
[2:56 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: does the product count equal the product count in the filters? no it does not
[3:02 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: do you write somewhere what I have asked you to do?
[3:04 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: somekind of log?

[3:42 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: yes, send me please what have you put into log since I dont want to write everthing again I have asked you to do
[6:30 pm, 08/02/2026] Maituikas Estonia: ?
